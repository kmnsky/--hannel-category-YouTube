# YouTube Channel Category Classifier

This is a Python script that uses the metadata of a YouTube channel, such as the name, keywords prescribed by the channel author, and a short description of the channel, to determine the category of the channel.

# Usage

To use this script, you will need to have a file containing the metadata for the YouTube channels you want to classify. The file should have a column for the channel name, a column for the channel keywords, and a column for the channel description.

The script will read the file and classify each channel based on the presence of certain keywords in the name, keywords, and description. It will output a new file with the category for each channel.
